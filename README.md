# üé¨Filmception-Movie-Genre-Predictor-Multilingual-Audio-Converter
This project is an interactive, menu-driven system designed to process movie summaries, predict their genres using machine learning, and convert the summaries into audio in multiple languages.

Users can input a movie summary and choose between two options:

Predict Genre(s): The system uses a multi-label classification model trained on the CMU Movie Summary dataset to predict relevant genres such as Action, Drama, Comedy, etc.

Convert to Audio: The input summary is translated into Arabic, Urdu, and Korean, and then converted into speech using a text-to-speech engine. Users can select their preferred language to listen to the summary.

üîç Features:
Text cleaning, tokenization, lemmatization, and preprocessing

Genre extraction and multi-label classification

Translation of summaries using NLP models or APIs

Audio generation in multiple languages
